# bikesharing
## Overview
The goal of this project is to show the "Ws" of bike rentals in New York City to help determine if it would be a feasable operation in Iowa: who, when, and where. The vizualisations show how the bikes are being used and how to best manage a similar operation.

## Results

This graph shows that the average ride peaks at about ten minutes, with relatively few rides lasting longer than 25 minutes. Theoretically, each bike could be used by as many as six unique riders per hour.

More men than women use the bikes each day, indicating that a marketing campaign should be aimed at men since it is more likely to be effective.

The majority of bikes are rented around the times that the workers would commute to and from work each weekday, and rented consistently throughout the day on Saturdays and Sundays. The data suggests that most repairs should take place between 12 am and 5 am, with a little extra time allowed on weekend mornings.

Once again, the data shows that men are far more likely to rent bikes than women, and are mostly rented for the daily work commute.

The more casual users who opt to not join the subscription program are far more likely to use the bikes more on the weekends. Men are more likely to join a subscription program and use it for their everyday trips, especially to and from work.

The closer to Manhattan the user is, the more likely they are to use the bikes. With the bourough being both a cultural and major business hub, more bikes will be rented near this area.

This chart confirms the obvious: The more a bike is used, the more repairs it will need over time.

## Summary
For the bikesharing venture to be feasible, the initial marketing campaigns must be aimed at men and it will do far better in a densely populated area where there are more users and getting around on bikes is easier than driving a car. I would like to see a breakdown of the map of Manhattan shown by non-subscribers only, as well as usage on weekends. These maps would tell a more complete story of who is using the bikes, as well as when and where.
